# Horizon Zero Dawn DRPC Client

## What is this project?

This is a small Discord Rich Presence console app that I'm working on. What it will do is run in the background when 
you're playing Horizon Zero Dawn PC, and check what you're doing, and display that as your Discord Rich Presence 
status, at least, ideally that's what it should do. 

Hopefully this can all be done by checking certain memory addresses and what they do. This is my first time digging 
into that territory and I sure hope it won't backfire on me. If it does, it'll exist purely to show 2 change in 
statuses, one for displaying you're not playing, and one for displaying you are playing. I just hope for more.
